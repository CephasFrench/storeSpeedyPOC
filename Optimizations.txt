We have  N  nodes in a 2D space and need to compute distances between each pair. We then focus on finding the shortest path starting from a node  n_0 , visiting a subset of nodes “Cart” (of size  L ), and returning to  n_0 .

Distance Calculation

	1.	Compute Distances: Calculate and store the Euclidean distances between all pairs of nodes in a matrix.
	2.	Number of Distances (#D): For  N  nodes, store \frac{N(N-1)}{2} unique distances.

Algorithm Choices and Complexity

	1.	Held-Karp Algorithm (Dynamic Programming for TSP)
		•	Complexity:  O(2^L \cdot L^2) 
		•	Use Case: Efficient and exact for small subsets  L < 20 .
	2.	Dijkstra’s Algorithm
		•	Complexity:  O((V + E) \log V) ; for dense graphs,  O(N^2 \log N) 
		•	Use Case: Efficient for large graphs and general shortest path problems.
	3.	A Algorithm*
		•	Complexity:  O(b^d) 
		•	Use Case: Efficient with a good heuristic; similar use case as Dijkstra’s but can be faster in specific scenarios.

Efficiency Analysis

	•	For  L < 20 :
	•	Held-Karp: Preferred for solving the TSP exactly within the subset.
	•	Efficient up to  N \approx 1000 ; beyond this, Dijkstra’s or A* becomes more practical for overall graph handling.
	•	For  N > 1000 :
	•	Dijkstra’s or A*: More efficient for processing the entire graph due to polynomial complexity compared to Held-Karp’s exponential growth.

Recommendations

	•	Use Held-Karp:
	•	When  L < 20  and  N  is less than approximately 1000 for exact solutions in the subset.
	•	Use Dijkstra’s or A*:
	•	When  N  is greater than approximately 1000 or for general pathfinding tasks outside the subset’s TSP context.

Table:
Algorithm       Complexity            Detailed Runtime Estimate  When Preferred
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Held-Karp       O(2^L * L^2)          7,372,800 operations        L < 20, N < 1000, exact TSP
Dijkstra's      O(N^2 log N)          10,000,000 operations       General shortest paths, large N

So for a car less than 20 items, Held-Karp is AT MINIMUM 35% faster.
